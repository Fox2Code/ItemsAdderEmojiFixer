# ItemsAdderEmojiFixer

ItemAdder emoji system was broken, so I made this plugin.

Fix serval bugs with ItemsAdder emoji system, including:
- Fix emojis appearing as `:mc_apple:` instead of `üçé` in chat on 1.19+.
- Fix `ia.user.image.use.*` permission not working properly.

It's not as good as if the original plugin worked, but it's still better than nothing.
