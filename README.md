# ItemsAdderEmojiFixer

ItemAdder emoji system was broken, so I made this plugin.  
It's also recommended to have chat encryption disabled on the server.

Fix serval bugs with ItemsAdder emoji system, including:
- Fix emojis appearing as `:mc_apple:` instead of `üçé` in chat on 1.19+.
- Fix `ia.user.image.use.*` permission not working properly.

Also in addition has the following features:
- Block vanilla commands that may cause mass kick with emojis due to chat signature.
- Discord support, supporting the translation of some emojis between in-game chat and Discord.

It's not as good as if the original plugin worked properly, but it's still better than nothing.
